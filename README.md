# Bank-marketing-campaign-predict-Customer-Segmentation
### The target from this project is to build an intelligent system to help marketing 
### team in bank to predict the client that will accept campaign and make deposit 
### and then make segmentation for the clients.

### the prediction model & Algorithm Evaluation. Model Tuning & Deployment with 
### steamlit and heroku
### project consist of four stages os notebook 
    1) notabook for cleaning and analysis the data 
    2) notebook for the predictive modeling for data using varouse machine learning algorithm 
    3) notebook for makeing customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learining 
    4) notebook fr deplpyment of the model it provide a user interface to the input data and show the result 
    
Marketing campaigns are characterized by focusing on customer needs and their overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, there are different variables that determine whether a marketing campaign will be successful or not. Some important aspects of a marketing campaign are as follows:

Segment of the Population: To which segment of the population is the marketing campaign going to address and why? This aspect of the marketing campaign is extremely important since it will tell which part of the population should most likely receive the message of the marketing campaign.

Distribution channel to reach the customer's place: Implementing the most effective strategy in order to get the most out of this marketing campaign. What segment of the population should we address? Which instrument should we use to get our message out? (Ex: Telephones, Radio, TV, Social Media Etc.)
